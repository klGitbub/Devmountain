// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain



//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "This is the second step, in which the specific details required for a system are gathered and the first ideas for prototypes are determined. Developers often create a software requirement specification or SRS document."
const design = "This is the third step, in which the details for the overall application, alongside specific aspects such as user interfaces, system interfaces, network and network requirements, and databases. Developers typically will turn the SRS document they created into a more logical structure that can later be implemented in a programming language."
const implementation = "This is the fourth step, in which the plan is taken and actually written in the coding syntax to make that come to right."
const testingAndIntegration = "This is the fifth step, in which a software implementation is packaged and tested to assure quality. Developers go through an drun a bunch of tests on your code to make sure that it works the way you expect it to work. After the testing is done, integration which is actually getting things hosted starts."
const softwareDevelopment = "This is the sixth step, in which the product is watched after it is hosted and deployed on the internet.  The product is monitored to see if there are any changes needed."
